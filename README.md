# VBA-challenges
Analyzing the stock market through examining its individual tickers, changes over time, and total stock volume.

The years examined are 2018-2020. To run the code, please copy and paste into VBA and select "This worksheet" to run it across all sheets included in the file.

This was a solo project! I accepted some input and advice from classmates and tutors, but the work is mine and mine alone.

Thank you!
